              <p>Willard Leon Sojourner was born September 10, 1948. One of George and Dorothy Sojourner's eleven children.</p>
              <p>During Willard's formative years he engaged in a variety of different sports, excelling in sports such as track and field as well as swimming. However due to his massive height (6ft 9), Willard was convinced by his highschool and father to drop the competitive swimming and focus on a vertically orientated sport instead.</p></br>

            <p>Willard was recruited by Weber State University. He did pretty well, broke some records, won some titles. Many would consider this a very successful basketball career.</p>
            <p>Willard also found the time to still compete at track and field. He placed 3rd in the 1970s NCAA high jump event, another highly notable achievement.</p>

            <p>Willard was selected in the second round of the 1971 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. He was also selected by the Virginia Squires in the ABA draft and for some strange reason chose to play for the squires over Chicago. He would later play for the New York Nets, another notable achievement in Willards life.</p>
            <h4>Virginia Squires (1971-1973)</h4>
            <p>He had a good time here, achieved much in terms of points and other basketball metrics.</p>
            <h4>New York Nets (1973-1975)</h4>
            <p>Willard was traded to the Nets due to financial issues with the squires. He had a nice time with the Nets, won a championship and some notable moments in which elderly Nets fans might remember.</p>
            <h4>Lancaster Roses (1975-1976)</h4>
            <p>He played for the Lancaster Roses and won a title.</p>
            <h4>Italy (1976-1983)</h4>
